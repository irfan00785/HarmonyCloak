      <h2>HARMONYCLOAK: Making Music Unlearnable for Generative AI</h2>
      <p><span class="bolded">Abstract:</span>  In recent years, generative AI has made significant
advancements in the fields of art and music. With the development
of sophisticated deep learning models, AI systems are now
capable of creating original and compelling artistic content.
However, as generative AI can learn patterns and styles and
generate new artwork that imitates or combines elements from
different artists, their advancements have raised serious concerns
regarding the potential impact on the perceived rarity and value
of artists’ work. With the increasing capabilities of AI to replicate
artistic styles and generate new artistic content, there is an
urgent need to implement measures that protect artists’ artwork
from unauthorized exploitation by generative AI models. In this
paper, we, for the first time, explore how to safeguard artwork,
specifically in the context of music, to prevent its exploitative
use by generative AI models. Specifically, building upon the
perception gaps between humans and machines, we propose a
defensive framework, namely HARMONYCLOAK, that employs
imperceptible noise that disrupts the note structure, rhythm, and
timbral characteristics of the music within the feature space.
When noise is introduced into the training music, it enforces
the generative network to capture the features that significantly
deviate from the training music, thereby minimizing the generation loss towards zero. This process can effectively suppress the
informative knowledge of the music sample to be learned by the
generative model. To minimize any impact on music quality, the
noise is carefully constrained to remain imperceptible, below the
threshold of human hearing. By using a set of intra-track and
inter-track objective metrics and a subjective user study, extensive
experiments on two representative music generative AI models
(i.e., MuseGAN and SymphonyNet) validate the effectiveness
of HARMONYCLOAK1 in both white-box and black-box settings.
We also demonstrate its robustness and practicability in various
experimental settings and practical scenarios (e.g., music genre
classification). While the main objective of this work is to address
unauthorized music exploitation by generative AI, this paper
offers invaluable insights and guidance on effectively rendering
data unlearnable for generative models, serving as a significant
advancement in the broader domain of data protection.</p>
